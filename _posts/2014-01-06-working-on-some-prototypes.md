Heya. So we’ve launched Top Snake and now it’s time to move on to our next project. (Though I will be trying to do a Post Mortem for Top Snake over the next couple of days).
<!--break-->

We haven’t decided on anything, but I have a dastardly plot to gamify [Tone Matrix](http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/). I won’t reveal all the details just yet, but I will share the prototype copy I’ve made this evening. You’ll need to install [Löve](https://love2d.org/) to run it. I threw [loveframes](http://nikolairesokav.com/projects/loveframes/) and [TEsound](https://love2d.org/wiki/TEsound) together to make it. Also used the sounds given by [fins](http://freesound.org/people/fins/). I was using Audacity to do some pitch adjustments, but it was actually really bad at detecting which pitch was being played and so the result wasn’t quite as expected. (If you have perfect pitch or something similar, you can tell the notes listed aren’t quite as advertised).

Anyway, if you’re interested in what our next project might be (but also might not be), check it out [here](http://coinflipgames.co/games/demos/tone-matrix/ToneMatrixCopy.love). Also, if you’re interested in seeing the (quickly thrown together) source code, change the .love extension to .zip, unzip and enjoy!
