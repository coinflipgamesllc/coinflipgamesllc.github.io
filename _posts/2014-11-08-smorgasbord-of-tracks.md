Throughout the development of Shuffle Grand Prix, we’re going to release details of the game. This week, we’re revealing that the tracks will be procedurally generated. Not only will this add longevity to the game, it will also result in tons of unique tracks that we could never even dream of creating.

The tracks will be generated by being supplied a string of characters that will be used as the seed. This allows players to not only join races with brand new tracks, but also replay old ones. We also plan on having a simple rating system that will allow the most popular tracks to be easily selected.

We have come up with a prototype for this and have included several screenshots of some of our favorite tracks. We will continue to reveal more details of Shuffle Grand Prix every couple of weeks, so keep checking our blog for updates!
