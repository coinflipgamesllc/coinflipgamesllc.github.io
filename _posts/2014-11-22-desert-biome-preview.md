Variety is the spice of life, and it’s no different with Shuffle Grand Prix!  Added to the feature list: biomes!  This week, we have a quick concept preview for the desert biome that we are working on.

Race in the heat of the desert sun!  Zig-zag and zoom over arid, rolling sand-dunes.  Stone archways, giant towering crags, distant looming mesas, moisture-rich cacti, punctuated by mysterious crystals!  Don’t get distracted and remember to stay hydrated; focus on winning the gold!

In addition to showing some of our concept artwork for the desert scenes, we have some initial screen shots of three hover-bike variations on display.  Low-poly is still our visual theme, and it’s holding up strong here!
