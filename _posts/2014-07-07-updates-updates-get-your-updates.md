We are excited to announce some updates to our game, Ravenous Ravenous Raptors. We originally made this game for the Bacon Game Jam a few months ago. This update is (late) post competition changes we felt should be in the game. The biggest change is the new GameJolt API integration for scores and achievements. We now have over 15 different achievements! Some of them are nearly impossible :smile:

In addition to that, we’ve got…

- **New controls**: We reworked the controls to give the player (you!) more control. control!
- **Raptor hunger bars**: The raptors now have an indicator to tell the robot exactly how hungry they are. Keep them fed!

- **Super Cow**: There’s a new special cow that will fill a raptor right up. Don’t ask why it glows…

New sounds, effects, **and scoring**: Really it’s just best to give the game a go.
