We are proud to announce that our next game will be called “Shuffle Grand Prix”. As you might guess from the title, Shuffle Grand Prix will be a racing game. It will also be set in the future. These details might not sound too ground breaking, but there are many more elements to the game that we are waiting to reveal!

We have worked hard on the design for this game and feel that it has a lot of potential. The screenshot we have included shows the general concept of the game. We still have a lot of work to do, so it will probably change dramatically by the time we are done. We have also set up a website for our new game at [www.shufflegrandprix.com](http://shufflegrandprix.com/). Keep an eye on our blog to see more exciting details about Shuffle Grand Prix as we get further along in development.
